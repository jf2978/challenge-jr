# Exactly Finance Technical Challenge (Jr.)

**Author:** Jeffrey Fabian
**Last Updated:** August 15, 2021

## Background

I recently reached out to the Exactly Finance team in hopes for a chance to prove my skills helpful in their goal to building an open, non-custodial financial protocol for fixed-rate lending and borrowing. Other protocol and platforms exist to a similar end, but all (that I'm aware of) do so at the cost of decentralization itself (e.g. Nexo, Celcius), income predictability (e.g. Aave, Compound) and/or ease of use (e.g. Yield Farming/Liquidity mining as a whole).

In short, I'm super interested in DeFi and recognize that the best way to learn is to start buildng.
