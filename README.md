# Rock-Paper-Scissors test project

You will create a smart contract named `RockPaperScissors` whereby:
Alice and Bob can play the classic game of rock, paper, scissors using ERC20 (of your choosing).

- To enroll, each player needs to deposit the right token amount, possibly zero.
- To play, each Bob and Alice need to submit their unique move.
- The contract decides and rewards the winner with all token wagered.

There are many ways to implement this, so we leave that up to you.

## Stretch Goals
Nice to have, but not necessary.
- Make it a utility whereby any 2 people can decide to play against each other.
- Reduce gas costs as much as possible.
- Let players bet their previous winnings.
- How can you entice players to play, knowing that they may have their funds stuck in the contract if they face an uncooperative player?
- Include any tests using Hardhat.

Now fork this repo and do it!
